# Introduction

Orwynn is a framework for building Python server-side applications. With main goal
of allowing developers building clean [Modular Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), it inherits many ideas from other frameworks, such as [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/).

Orwynn is built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), which means that all the advantages of FastAPI are available here, although, they appear in
different forms. You will see the usage differences in details in later sections.

So, keeping in mind ability to ease building architectural solutions faster, Orwynn also strives to create a solid infrastructure, much like it does Angular, with one entrypoint and approach to test, scale and maintain your applications.

## Installation

The only thing you probably need to install Orwynn:
```bash
pip install orwynn
```

After that, for many cases it's recommended to create your new project using [Generate CLI](GenerateCLI.md), which will be covered in details in [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md).
